# bmp_to_gray
C++ program for bmp file to make gray

As it is the first version, which I started 4 months ago and abandoned it, it still has some lags, but still, it is working.

As for now, filename is in code, and it is called "image.bmp", so only this filename works.

!WARNING!

I've noticed that not everu bmp pricture is processing, it is caused by my restrictions in class.
If someone is reading this and he/she wants to improve this program - I am opened to any suggestions.

This program was made with WholeLottaRain, my friend and groupmate from MAI, Oleg Yablokov.
